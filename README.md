# **Rust Staking Contract** 🚀

This project demonstrates how to interact with a **Solidity-based staking smart contract** using Rust. It allows users to **stake**, **unstake**, and check their **staked balance** using the `ethers-rs` library.

## **Overview** 🌟

This project is a **Rust-based CLI tool** that interacts with a staking smart contract deployed on a blockchain (e.g., Ethereum or a local testnet). It uses the `ethers-rs` library to send transactions and call methods on the smart contract.

### **Key Features**:
- **Stake tokens** into the contract.
- **Unstake tokens** from the contract.
- **Check the staked balance** of a wallet.
